# Finhay Market

Read-only market data via the Finhay Securities Open API. All requests are signed `GET`.

> **MANDATORY**: Before any action, read and complete [pre-flight checks](./_shared/preflight.md). Required: `FINHAY_API_KEY`, `FINHAY_API_SECRET`. `USER_ID` not needed for market endpoints. Do not skip or defer.

## Making a Request

Use [request.sh](./_shared/scripts/request.sh) for every call.

```bash
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "symbol=VNM"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "symbols=VNM,VIC,HPG"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/stock-realtime "exchange=HOSE"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/financial-data/gold
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/price-histories-chart "symbol=VNM&resolution=1D&from=1609459200&to=1704067200"
./_shared/scripts/request.sh GET /market/financial-data/macro "type=CPI&country=VN&period=YEARLY"
```

## Endpoints

| `/market/funds` | Fund list, NAV | — | — |
| `/market/funds/:fund/portfolio` | Fund holdings | `:fund` | `month` (optional) |
| `/market/financial-data/gold`, `silver` | Gold/silver spot price | — | — |
| `/market/financial-data/gold-chart`, `silver-chart` | Gold/silver price chart | — | `days` (default 30) |

| `/market/recommendation-reports/:symbol` | Analyst reports | `:symbol` | — |
| `/market/price-histories-chart` | OHLCV price history | — | `symbol`, `resolution` (only `1D`), `from`, `to` (seconds) |

### Parameter rules

- Each endpoint accepts **only** the parameters listed in its path and query columns above. Do not add extra parameters.
- All `:variables` in the URL are **path** variables — substitute them into the URL, never pass as query params.

Details & response shapes: [references/endpoints.md](./references/endpoints.md).

## Constraints

See [shared constraints](./_shared/constraints.md), plus:

- **Stock realtime** — pass exactly one of `symbol`, `symbols`, or `exchange`. Never combine them.
- **Price history** — `from` and `to` are Unix timestamps in **seconds**, not milliseconds. If a value exceeds 9,999,999,999, stop and ask the user to convert. `resolution` must be `1D`. When not provided, default `to` to now and `from` to 5 years ago.
